# published, so there is no registry version to fall back on. Clone
# https://github.com/tabnas/parser and https://github.com/tabnas/abnf next
# to this repo before running. `tabnas-abnf` in turn depends on
# https://github.com/tabnas/bnf, which gets no entry in rs/Cargo.toml but
# has to be on disk all the same: cargo reads the whole manifest graph
# before it compiles anything. The test suite needs two more siblings,
# https://github.com/tabnas/support, the shared fixture runner, and
# https://github.com/tabnas/debug, the introspection plugin the
# composition test layers on the grammar.

# that toolchain: it resolves the `1.85` channel, finds it absent, and

# matched and run cargo through that name, never through the

# it in the runner and everything goes green.

# one exemption per path dependency: the sibling crate's recorded

# does, which is what makes a full comparison usable here when blanket
